# Migrate State to Terraform Cloud

This is a companion repository for the Hashicorp [Terraform Cloud workspace state migration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-migrate) tutorial.

The repository contains configuration you can use to learn how to migrate your existing state file to a Terraform Cloud workspace.


In this POC, understood the terraform cloud and did the state migration form local to terraform cloud.
